# Internal Team Social Network Frontend Requirements

## Scope and Goals
- Deliver a Flutter-based mobile client for iOS and Android that mirrors backend capabilities across social feed, profiles, messaging, notifications, and admin needs.
- Support light and dark themes, localization readiness (English default), and responsive layouts for phones and tablets.
- Target Flutter 3.22+ and Dart 3.3+; support minimum iOS 14 and Android 8.0.
- Follow repository module guidelines with feature-first organization under `frontend/lib/`.

## Architecture Foundations
- Adopt scalable state management (Riverpod or Bloc) per feature with immutable view models and repository abstraction for API access.
- Partition each feature into presentation, domain, and data layers; store shared UI components in `lib/widgets/`, utilities in `lib/utils/`, and theming in `lib/theme/`.
- Implement environment-aware configuration (`FlavorConfig`) to manage API base URLs, WebSocket endpoints, and feature flags for dev/stage/prod.
- Enforce strict typing with code generation (e.g., `json_serializable`) where useful; enable linting via `flutter analyze` and format with `dart format`.

## Networking and Data Flow
- Consume REST APIs over HTTPS for CRUD operations and WebSockets for messaging, presence, and notifications.
- Handle JWT access headers, refresh token flow, and exponential backoff on transient failures.
- Implement automatic WebSocket reconnection, heartbeats, and backpressure handling.
- Respect cursor-based pagination, map DTOs to domain models, and log requests/responses in debug builds only.
- Support multipart uploads for images/files and secure download handling (signed URLs, content-type checks).

## Local Storage and Offline Support
- Use encrypted local databases (`hive` or `isar`) to cache feeds, profiles, messages, and notifications.
- Store auth tokens securely via `flutter_secure_storage`.
- Provide offline-first UX with local drafts, optimistic updates, sync badges, and retry queues for pending actions.
- Cache image thumbnails using `cached_network_image` with smart eviction aligned to per-user storage quotas.

## Authentication and Onboarding
- Splash screen determines auth state and bootstraps cached data.
- Implement email/password login, registration, password reset (if backend exposes), and logout that invalidates server tokens.
- Validate forms with real-time feedback, password strength hints, and inline API error surfacing.
- Post-auth onboarding for profile completion (avatar, bio, department) and optional tutorial walkthrough.

## Profiles and Team Directory
- Directory screen lists all members with search and filters (name, username, email, department).
- Profile detail displays avatar, status, role, bio, contact actions, and recent posts.
- Allow users to edit their profile, upload avatar, and set custom status; show online/offline presence synced with backend.
- Provide quick actions to start chat or view shared groups from a profile.

## Feed and Post Experiences
- Chronological home feed with infinite scroll, pull-to-refresh, skeleton loading states, and filter chips (user, department).
- Post composer supports rich text (markdown-lite preview), media attachments (respecting size limits), file attachments, and @mentions via picker.
- Post detail includes media gallery, file downloads, share-to-own timeline, edit/delete for owners, and pin/unpin for admins.
- Implement like reactions with animated feedback and counters.

## Comments and Interactions
- Inline comments with pagination, single-level threaded replies, and @mentions.
- Allow editing/deleting user-owned comments with optimistic UI and undo snackbars.
- Support sharing posts with optional commentary and surface engagement metrics when provided by backend.

## Messaging System
- Conversation list merges direct and group chats with recent activity ordering, unread badges, mute/archive filters, and search.
- Conversation view features bubble layout, inline replies, typing indicators, read receipts, delivery states, attachments preview, and message context menus (copy/edit/delete).
- Message composer includes emoji picker, file picker, mention support, and placeholders for future voice messages.
- Group management flow covers creation, member management, leave group, name/photo edits, and role-based permissions.
- Conversation settings include mute, archive, and clear history actions, with confirmation prompts.

## Notifications
- In-app notification center for messages, reactions, comments, mentions, group invitations, and admin alerts with read/unread states.
- Real-time updates via WebSocket plus badge counts on relevant tabs and icons.
- Allow mark-as-read (single/all), swipe-to-clear interactions, and deep linking into appropriate feature screens.
- Optional push notification integration (FCM/APNs) contingent on backend support.

## Search and Discovery
- Global search entry in top-level navigation covering users, posts, and chats with segmented results and recent search history.
- Implement debounced server queries and highlight matches in results.

## File and Media Handling
- Provide media viewers for images (zoom, swipe) and delegated native handlers for documents (PDF, Office, TXT).
- Show upload/download progress with resumable support where possible; enforce per-file and aggregate size limits with user feedback.
- Expose storage usage summaries in settings and warnings approaching quota.

## Admin Surfaces
- For admin users, expose user management lists (activate/deactivate, role updates), reported content queues, and lightweight analytics snapshots.
- Apply role-based access derived from backend claims and hide admin UI from standard users.

## Settings and Preferences
- Account settings: profile, password change, notification preferences, two-step verification placeholder pending backend.
- App settings: theme toggle, language selector, cache management, diagnostics/log export, about/license information.
- Allow manual sync trigger and feedback submission channel.

## Error Handling and Feedback
- Provide consistent empty/error states (network outage, permission issues, no results) with retry options.
- Use toasts/snackbars for ephemeral events and modal dialogs for destructive actions or critical confirmations.
- Integrate optional crash/error reporting SDKs (e.g., Sentry) gated behind privacy settings.

## Accessibility and UX Quality
- Adhere to WCAG AA equivalents: scalable fonts, color contrast, screen reader labels, focus management, and haptic feedback.
- Ensure RTL readiness and test with system accessibility features.

## Testing and Quality Assurance
- Achieve â‰¥80% test coverage across unit, widget, golden, and integration tests.
- Mock backend interactions for deterministic tests; run `flutter analyze`, `dart format`, and `flutter test` in CI.
- Prepare integration test suite under `frontend/test_driver/` for end-to-end flows (auth, posting, messaging).

## Release and DevOps Considerations
- Maintain flavor-based builds (dev/stage/prod) with distinct icons, splash screens, and config bundles.
- Document environment setup, API configuration, and build steps in `frontend/README.md`.
- Support build automation scripts for code generation, linting, and packaging; integrate crashlytics/analytics toggles per flavor.

## Future Expansion
- Design architecture to accommodate stories, richer reactions, voice/video calling, and improved analytics.
- Centralize design tokens in `lib/theme/` for easy scaling and theming.
- Instrument screen usage analytics hooks to feed backend metrics when available.
